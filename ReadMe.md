- This project was created with React Native
- Inspired by Academind @ https://github.com/Code4Blessings/rn-Guess-A-Number.git

## React-Native/React Snippets
- *irmc* - import for React
- *irnc* - import for React-Native
- *rncslwc* - complete react-native skeleton
- *rnss* - stylesheet section

- Operates just like a div in React.js
- Has a built-in flexbox with a default of flex-direction: column

## Shadow Properties
- Only works on IOS. To fix this, we add an elevation property.
